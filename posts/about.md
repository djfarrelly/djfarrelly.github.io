I'm Dan. I am a co-founder and CTO at [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com). I spent previous several years as CTO at [Buffer](https://buffer.com). Back when I had more time I built [Timezone.io](https://timezone.io) (service, [open-source](https://github.com/timezoneio/timezoneio)) and [MailDev](https://maildev.github.io/maildev/) (dev tool, [open-source](https://github.com/maildev/maildev)).

In 2020 I bought a 96 year old house and started [a restoration and renovation project](https://www.instagram.com/michigancraftsman/) on the weekends. Hit me up if you want to chat home renovations.

You can email me if you'd like at dan\[at\]inngest.com.
